/* in  java, abstr̥action can be achieved by two ways :

abstract is a keyword in java that is used to make a method abstract.
//abstr̥act method have no body and hiding the internal implementation

interface
(purely abstract. there is non abstract method in interfaces. therefore, we can achieved 100 % abstraction.)
abstract class

best method is interface, there is 100% surety of abstract method)
